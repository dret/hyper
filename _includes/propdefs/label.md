The purpose for the h:label property is best explain by this quote from
the ([Hypermedia Project Charter](https://github.com/the-hypermedia-project/charter/blob/master/reference/hypermedia-elements.md)):

> Some formats provide ways to give a human-readable label to an attribute.
> For example, where first_name is the attribute, "First Name" may be the
> label.
